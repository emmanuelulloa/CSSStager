HTML5 banner made easy.
So I needed a tool to quickly prepare the layout of my animations and this is the result.
Drop images within the 'stage' area and the tool will generate div styles using the image name, size and the image as a background.
You can make an animation container by using a background image.
With the mouse move around the items to set up your layout.
